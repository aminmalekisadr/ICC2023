## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Before Installing
To ensure a smooth process, please ensure you have the following requirements.

**Hardware**
- Nvidia GPU with Compute Capability 3.5 or higher


**Software**

The following Softwares and Packages are recommended to be used before installation
```
Python: 3.6.1
Numpy: 1.12.1
Pandas: 0.20.1
Keras: 2.0.6
Scikit-Learn: 0.18.1
Theano: 0.9.0
Tensorflow: 1.2.1
Pydot: 1.0.29
GraphViz: 2.38.0
CUDA: 11.0
```
### Installation
Clone this repository, and then install it and its requirements. It should be something similar to this:

```
git clone     https://github.com/aminmalekisadr/ICC2022.git
pip3 install -e ICC2022/
pip3 install -r ICC2022/requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
We use the satellite telemetry data from NASA. The dataset comes from two spacecrafts: the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite (SMAP) and the Curiosity Rover on Mars (MSL).
There are 82 signals available in the NASA dataset. We found that 54 of the 82 signals  to be continuous by inspection, and the remaining signals were discrete.  We only consider the time-series sequences from the telemetry signals in our evaluation, where the telemetry values can be discrete or continues in these signals.

The dataset is available [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/telemanom/data.zip). If the link is broken or something is not working properly, please contact me through email (aminmalekisadr@gmail.com).
## Experiments
### Configuration

 These parameters are used to setup the Genetic Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Networks and Random Forests, MC dropout used in training for the model.
 
```
mutation_rate = 0.1  # Mutation rate for GA
min_mutation_momentum = 0.0001  # Min mutation momentum
max_mutation_momentum = 0.1  # Max mutation momentum
min_population = 20  # Min population for GA
max_population = 50  # Max population for GA
num_Iterations = 10  # Number of iterations to evaluate GA
look_back = 1  # Num of timespaces to look back for training and testing
max_dropout = 0.2  # Maximum percentage of dropout
max_MC_dropout = 0.2  # Maximum percentage of dropout
min_num_layers = 1  # Min number of hidden layers
max_num_layers = 10  # Max number of hidden layers
min_num_neurons = 10  # Min number of neurons in hidden layers
max_num_neurons = 100  # Max number of neurons in hidden layers
min_num_estimators = 100  # Min number of random forest trees
max_num_estimators = 500  # Max number of random forest trees
rnn_epochs = 1  # Epochs for RNN
```

### Running an Experiment

Assuming you have set a configuration file in /path/to/config.yaml, and the configuration file's input_file option contains the path to the downloaded data, these are the steps to fully run an experiment:

``` 
python main.py   /path/to/config.yaml  dataset-name 

```
